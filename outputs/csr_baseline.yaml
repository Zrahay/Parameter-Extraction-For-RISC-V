parameters:
  - name: CSR address encoding space width
    description: CSR address uses a 12-bit encoding space denoted csr[11:0].
    type: size
    constraints:
      width_bits: 12
      bit_range: "[11:0]"
  - name: Maximum number of CSRs
    description: A 12-bit CSR address space allows up to 4,096 CSRs.
    type: limit
    constraints:
      max_csrs: 4096
      derived_from_bits: 12
  - name: CSR accessibility encoding field (upper nibble)
    description: By convention, the upper 4 bits of the CSR address encode read/write accessibility and privilege accessibility.
    type: encoding
    constraints:
      bit_range: "[11:8]"
      field_width_bits: 4
  - name: CSR read/write vs read-only encoding
    description: The top two bits of the CSR address indicate whether the CSR is read/write or read-only.
    type: encoding
    constraints:
      bit_range: "[11:10]"
      field_width_bits: 2
      encodings:
        "00": read_write
        "01": read_write
        "10": read_write
        "11": read_only
  - name: CSR minimum privilege level encoding
    description: The next two bits of the CSR address encode the lowest privilege level that can access the CSR.
    type: encoding
    constraints:
      bit_range: "[9:8]"
      field_width_bits: 2
